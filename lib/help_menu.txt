Install options (must pass at least one of these options)
  -a         | Allow ignored files to be installed
  -f         | Install all dotfiles
  -s [FILE]  | Install a single dotfile
  -v         | Install vimfiles
  -z         | Install 'oh-my-zsh'
  -b         | Install 'bash-it'

Additional install options (default: Don't add these settings)
  -C [SHELL] | Change login shell to [SHELL]
  -i         | Enable terminal italics

Handling old dotfiles; pass with '-f' (default: Do nothing if they exist)
  -F         | Force overwrite of all current dotfiles
  -B         | Replace old dotfiles, but save them with '.bak' extension
  -L         | If file already exists, move it to [FILE].local. This is
             + different from '-B', because my dotfiles will source a file
             + of the same name if it's in the home directory with the
             + '.local' extension. This allows for additional settings to
             + be applied on different systems.
