# dotfiles
My dotfiles. Here be dragons.

### Installation
I doubt you'd want to use my exact config, so I'd recommend just copying the
lines of code that you want and put them in your own config files... but if
you're looking to get weird, you can clone the entire repo. Just make sure to
link files that should be dotfiles in your home directory like so:

```sh
ln -s $PATH_TO_REPO/bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

Obviously, replace `$PATH_TO_REPO` with the actual path to where you cloned the
repository.
